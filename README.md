# Pi-Monte-Carlo-Cluster
This is a program that simulates a user-desired number of Raspberry Pi's that operate together and utilize a Monte Carlo Simulation to calculate pi. This calculation depends on the desired sizes of the system, data inputs, and number of outputs and combines the randomly inserted points on a circle to them combine them for pi estimation.
